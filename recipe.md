Method
1- To make the eggless cake, in a large bowl, whisk together all purpose flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, 3/4 teaspoon cardamom powder and salt. Sift this mixture once and set aside.

2- Meanwhile mix 1 cup milk with 1 tablespoon white vinegar and set aside for 5 minutes while it curdles. (or use 1 cup buttermilk)

3- Using paddle attachment of your stand mixer or use your hand mixer, beat together oil and powdered sugar. Mix until creamy and well combined.

4- Then add in the vanilla and mix.

5- Start adding the flour mixture and milk-vinegar mixture in parts. First add the flour mixture and mix, followed by the milk-vinegar mixture.
6- Add the flour-mix in 3 parts and milk-vinegar mixture in 2 parts, starting and ending with the flour mix. Do not over-mix. The batter is now done.
7- Transfer batter to a 9 x 13 inch pan. Baked 350 F degrees for around 15 to 18 minutes. This is a thin cake layer so it bakes quickly. If using a 8-inch square pan, this will take around 25 minutes or so check accordingly.

8- Let the cake cool down, and then using a round cookie cutter, cut the sheet cake layer into 8 rounds. Choose the cookie cutter size according to the size of your serving glasses/jars. You will not need to use all of these cake layers in the recipe.

Further slice each round into two layers, we will arrange these slices into the jars. Set this aside and then work on the whipped cream.

9- To the steel bowl of your stand mixer (or use your hand mixer) add 2 cups of heavy whipping cream. Make sure the cream is cold, you can also chill the bowl and whisk attachment before.

10- Add 3 tablespoons ras (thickened milk from the rasmalai), powdered sugar, cardamom powder and rasmalai essence (if you have it).

11- Beat using the wire whisk attachment until it forms still peaks. Remember to not over-beat else cream will separate.

12- Now, itâ€™s time to assemble the rasmalai cake jars. Take your serving glasses and add a single sliced cake layer at the bottom (single layer from the two layers that we had cut from the rounds).

13- Add around 3 teaspoons of ras (thickened milk from the rasmalai) on top of the cake layer.  You can also sprinkle some nuts here and also add a splash of kewra water.

14- Pipe some of the prepared whipped cream on top.  You can now add a sliced/cut rasmalai piece here (that will double the rasmalai layer in the jar) but I did not.

15- Top with the other half of the sliced cake layer (from the cut rounds) and then add 3 more teaspoons of ras.

16- Finally top with more whipped cream. Place a full or half rasmalai on top (I used a cut rasmalai).
