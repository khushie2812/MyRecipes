How To Make Rasmalai Cake Jars
So there are 3 main components of this recipe!

1. Rasmalai: start by making Rasmalai (that is if you are going to make it at home).
2. Eggless sponge cake: once you have the rasmalai ready to go, the next thing is to make an eggless cake or any basic vanilla cake that you want.
3. Whipped cream: the whipped cream is the third integral part of this recipe. The cream is sweetened with the ras (the thickened milk) from the rasmalai.
